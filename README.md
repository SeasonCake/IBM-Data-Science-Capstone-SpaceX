# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

### IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains the final capstone project for the IBM Applied Data Science Professional Certificate. The project implements a complete data science pipeline to predict the landing success of a SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage. Predicting the outcome of a first-stage landing is crucial as it directly impacts the cost of a launch, with successful landings enabling rocket reuse.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. This is achieved through a systematic workflow encompassing several key stages of the data science lifecycle:

1.  **Data Collection:** Gathering historical launch data from the SpaceX REST API and scraping a supplemental data table from Wikipedia.
2.  **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning, merging, and transforming the raw data into a usable format. This includes creating the target variable `Class` for our classification models.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizing SQL queries and data visualization with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to uncover initial insights and relationships within the dataset.
4.  **Interactive Visual Analytics:** Building interactive geographical maps with `Folium` and a dynamic dashboard with `Plotly Dash` to explore the data in a more user-friendly way.
5.  **Predictive Modeling:** Training, fine-tuning via `GridSearchCV`, and evaluating several classification models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors) to find the best predictor of launch success.
